# Credit_Risk

## An overview of the analysis
The overall goal was to create a model that predicted the creditworthiness of borrowers.
Parameter of the model included:
1. loan size
2. Size of debt
3. Interest rate
4. How much the borrower made more than what he owed
5. derogatory marks

## The results
Model 1
* Precision: 1
* Recall: Healthy = 0.99 / Unhealthy = 0.91
* Accuracy: 99%

Model 2
Precision: 1
Recall: Healthy = 1.00 / Unhealthy = .85
Accuracy: 99%
## A summary
In the end we find that both models were both very accurate. It would appear that model 2 came out on top as it had a accuracy of 99%. For this reason I would recomend the second model for anyone trying to uses these models.
